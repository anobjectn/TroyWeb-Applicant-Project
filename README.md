# TroyWeb-Applicant-Project

I was running this site as: https://applicant-lo.troyweb.com
and this is what is in the database options table for siteurl and home. 
Feel free to change this to suit your needs either in the DB or with constants in wp-config.php 

The Troy Web named applicant is at https://applicant-lo.troyweb.com/applicant/troy-web/ 

Dont forget to create your wp-config.php file using the wp-config-sample.php but really its
a standard setup.

The Custom Post Types and Taxonomies are registered using ACF Pro, because I prefer this way,
so the posts remain if the theme is changed. Yes, I could have added as must-use plugin.
In any case, I saved PHP example of what I would have used if I had used PHP for this in the file 
_custom-post-types-and-taxonomies.php
