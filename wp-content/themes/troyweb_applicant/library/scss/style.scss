Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

/*********************
IMPORTING PARTIALS
These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all
our mixins, functions, and variables that we'll be using across
the whole project.
*********************/

// normalize: http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
@use "partials/normalize";

// Sass variables
@use "partials/variables";

// typography
@use "partials/typography";

// Sass functions
@use "partials/functions";

// import mixins
@use "partials/mixins";

// import mixins
@use "partials/responsive";

@import "partials/grid";

/**
* Gutenberg Styles.
*
* Now enqueued in a separate function in functions.php to
* keep styles out of the main stylesheet. Alternatively
* you can comment out the Gutenberg styles enqueue and 
* uncomment this below to have a single stylesheet.
* You do you.
*/
// @import "partials/gutenberg";

/*********************
IMPORTING MODULES
Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
I mean, you can do whatever you want. The world is your oyster. Unless
you hate oysters, then the world is your peanut butter & jelly sandwich.
*********************/

// alert boxes
@import "modules/alerts";

// buttons
@import "modules/buttons";

// forms (inputs & labels)
@import "modules/forms";

/*********************
BASE STYLESHEET
These are the base styles and it's loaded on every device. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.
*********************/

// styles in base.scss
@import "breakpoints/base";


/*********************
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
*********************/
@media print {
    // styles in print.scss
    @import "partials/print";
}
